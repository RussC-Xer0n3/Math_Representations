# Math_Representations
Convert algebraic symbols to code logic - Java

## Therefor
With regards to therefor, we can write a separate because method which recurrently calls therefor and sends data, once processed we can ascertain a representation of the data variable according to the sub callback methods which can be written bespokely into the Therefor template. In example

### If *because()* is used with a bespoke *therefor* template
***because** new data type is sent to **therefore.type()** and is a byte and **therefore.type()** has processed byte as an integer. **because** it is an integer we can send it again as a type to **therefor.type()** and get a secondary processing of the number. If the result is then a float or double we can send it again to **therefor.type()** for more bespoke processing according to the unique modification of the template*
