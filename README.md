Algebraic symbols as code logic - Java

Because often Algebra is generic to an expression of an idea or concept without finite values (until finite vlues are used), these classes should work on the Object data type. Object datatypes in Java can be any type of data and Therefore.java, intitially attempts to classify the data contained within the Object datatype. 

Often I have found recently as a developer and enthusiast, I cannot Objectify my code or variables adequately enough to form expressions within code. As a starter project for those who wish to help, this one is a good starter for the applied mathematical engineer.

In example, if we have *Object b = 2* or *Object a = "hello"*, we have two perfectly acceptable variables of type Object with two different datatypes contained at the memory reference.

The difficulty comes in when we have to process an Object of multityes such as multi-dimensional arrays *Object[] [] c = {1, 2, "the", 0x01, {,,}}* or even hashmaps *Map(Object<int>, Object<String>) myMap = new HashMap();*.

These types of objects need further processing and thus Therefore.java and Because.java are not yet complete.

## Therefor class

### What is it?
### *A base class template for defining therefore statements according to type definition in example - use this class when working with autonomous data where the return type and value from the calling method is uncertain, write each variant of this class according to your desired processing requirements per type definition output*

With regards to therefor, we can write a separate because method which recurrently calls therefor and sends data, once processed we can ascertain a representation of the data variable according to the sub callback methods which can be written bespokely into the Therefor template. In example

### If *because()* is used with a bespoke *therefor* template
***because** new data type is sent to **therefore.type()** and is a byte and **therefore.type()** has processed byte as an integer. **because** it is an integer we can send it again as a type to **therefor.type()** and get a secondary processing of the number. If the result is then a float or double we can send it again to **therefor.type()** for more bespoke processing according to the unique modification of the template* 

### Uses?
used in conjuntion with Because class or as is.
